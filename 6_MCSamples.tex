\chapter{Monte Carlo (MC) Samples}
\label{sec:MCSamples}

In order to analyze the data we use the computer-generated so-called pseudo-data samples using the software that simulates the physical processes that happen in the detector. This pseudo-data is also called "Monte Carlo" or MC and its purpose is to construct the data samples based on the theoretical predictions of our physical model. Ideally, the MC samples should be as close to the experimental data as possible, allowing us to inspect all stages of the analysis with a great accuracy. MC is used for tuning of the reconstruction algorithms (see Section~\ref{sec:Reconstruction}), calibration of the calorimeter (see Section~\ref{sec:Calibration}), calculation of the efficiencies (see Section~\ref{sec:Efficiency}), estimation of the background (see Section~\ref{sec:Bkg}), and finally for the comparison of the data to theoretical predictions (see Section~\ref{sec:Results}). Unfortunately, we are unable to reproduce data samples precisely, so some corrections are made by means of reweightings (see Section~\ref{sec:MC_correction}).

\end{figure}

The process of of MC samples generation consists of several stages, which can be seen in the diagram of the MC production chain in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_gen}. Here the short descriptions of every step of the production are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The simulation of $pp$ collisions, which involves the production and the decay of high-energy particles (done by the MC generators, see Section~\ref{sec:MC_gen}).
\item The simulation of interactions between the high-energy particles and the detector material (done by the Geant4 software~\cite{lib:geant4}, see Section~\ref{sec:MC_sim}).
\item The simulation of the detector response based on the amount of deposited energy in different parts of the detectors (done by the ATLAS software).
\item The reconstruction process runs the same way as for the experimental data samples, it is fully described in Chapter~\ref{sec:Reconstruction}.
\end{enumerate}
The simulation process takes a lot of time, with the most time-consuming process being the simulation of the particles passage through the detector, or even more precise, through the EM-calorimeters, as the calorimeters consist of very dense materials (e.g. lead and liquid argon) and hence the incoming high-energy particles produce showers with the tens of thousands of lower-energy particles. There are several techniques used to speed up this process, but most of them produce results that are different from the standard not-optimized simulation, which makes them unusable for many types of analysis (including \Zee). The only technology which gives the result close enough to the standard simulation to be enabled for all analysis samples by default is the Frozen Showers, which will be fully described in Section~\ref{sec:MC_FS}. In the following sections the details of the steps involved in the MC production chain are discussed. In Section~\ref{sec:MC_gen} the details of the various MC generators (first step) are given, and in Section~\ref{sec:MC_sim} the rest of the production chain is discussed, with the focus on the simulation of the passage of the high-energy particles through the detector (second stage) and the digitization process (third stage). The reconstruction process is discussed fully in Section~\ref{sec:Reconstruction}.

\section{MC generators used in ATLAS experiment}
\label{sec:MC_gen}

The first stage of the MC production is the simulation of the $pp$ collision itself. The simulation of this process is based on the Standard Model, and tries to account for every significant aspect of it. The core of the simulation is the calculation of the matrix element (ME) of the $pp$ interaction, which can be done in different orders. The simplest case is the leading order (LO), which is the bare Drell-Yan diagram in case of the \Zee, with no loops or extra legs. The simulations in the leading order are not precise, and generally the next to leading order (NLO) or next to next to leading order (NNLO) are used instead, with one or two extra loops/legs respectively. The calculation of the matrix element at higher orders is very complex, and in order to increase the precision of the simulation the additional particles are simulated outside of the ME. Additional QCD particles are generated using the "parton shower" (PS) technique, which simulates the QCD radiation from each parton independently. The PS technique is widely adopted and used in many MC generators. Additional QED radiation is generated in a similar way by the independent package named "Photos"~\cite{lib:photos}, with the similar technique. This package can be used in conjunction with other MC generators.

Here is the list of the MC generators used in ATLAS analyses:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Herwig~\cite{lib:MC_herwig} is a general-purpose event generator for high-energy processes, with particular emphasis on the detailed simulation of QCD parton showers. The program provides a full simulation of hard lepton-lepton, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron scattering and soft hadron-hadron collisions in a single package, and has the following special features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Initial- and final-state QCD jet evolution with soft gluon interference taken into account via angular ordering.
\item Color coherence of (initial and final) partons in all hard subprocesses, including the production and decay of heavy quarks and supersymmetric particles.
\item Azimuthal correlations within and between jets due to gluon interference and polarization.
\item A cluster model for jet hadronization based on non-perturbative gluon splitting, and a similar cluster model for soft and underlying hadronic events.
\item A space-time picture of event development, from parton showers to hadronic decays, with an optional color rearrangement model based on space-time structure.
\end{itemize}
In the current analysis \Herwig\ was used to provide the parton showering for other generators.

\item \Pythia~\cite{lib:MC_pythia6} (and an updated version \Pythiaeight~\cite{lib:MC_pythia8}) is a generator with the goal to provide as accurate as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those where strong interactions play a role, directly or indirectly, and therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then not understood well enough to give an exact description, instead the program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and various QCD-based models.

\item \Powheg~\cite{lib:MC_powheg} is a hard scattering event generator for heavy quark production in hadronic collisions. It is accurate at the next-to-leading order in QCD, and it can be interfaced with shower Monte Carlo programs like \Herwig\ and \Pythia, in such a way that both the leading logarithmic accuracy of the shower and the NLO accuracy of the ME are maintained in the output. This generator is the main MC generator used in 2011 analyses.

\item \Mcatnlo~\cite{lib:MC_mcatnlo} is a practical implementation, based upon the Fortran \Herwig\ and \Herwigpp\ event generators, of the \Mcatnlo\ formalism, which allows one to incorporate NLO QCD matrix elements consistently into a parton shower framework.

\item \Sherpa~\cite{lib:MC_sherpa1, lib:MC_sherpa2} is a multi-purpose tool which contains a very flexible tree-level matrix-element generator for the calculation of hard scattering processes within the Standard Model and various new physics models.  The emission of additional QCD partons off  the  initial  and  final  states  is  described through a parton-shower model without the need of an additional generator. This generator is only for the signal MC only.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Signal MC}

The part of Monte Carlo simulation which represents \Zee\ events is called "signal MC". The signal MC is the main component of all the simulated MC. Its samples are used for the data unfolding (deconvolution), which is the process that aims to translate the number of reconstructed events into the true number of events in each bin. The unfolding procedure is described in Section~\ref{sec:ZeeCrossSec}. As well as Standard Model itself, the MC generators have parameters which can't be theoretically predicted, and should be found empirically. This process is called "MC tuning", and is done separately for every experiment, because the tune which will describe well one experiment won't fit for other. The tunes used in ATLAS are described in~\cite{lib:MC_tune1, lib:MC_tune2}.

The other important part of MC customization is the PDF set. The definition of the PDF can be seen in Section~\ref{sec:TH_PDF}. The PDF sets used in the current analyses are CT10 NLO for the matrix element and CTEQ6L1 for the showering. They are decribed in~\cite{lib:MC_pdfct10, lib:MC_pdfcteq6l1}.

\subsection{Background MC}

The part of Monte Carlo simulation which represents different processes which can be misinterpreted as \Zee\ is called "background MC". There are several background processes that can be simulated using MC, and most of them (all but one) are electroweak processes, that is why the background MC is also called an "electroweak background" as opposed to the "multi-jet background" (or "QCD background") which is the background from the multi-jet hadronic processes, which cannot be reliably simulated.

We use seven different types of backgrond MCs:
\begin{itemize}
\item \Wenu, the decay of a $W$ boson into an electron and a neutrino. This process can be misinterpreted as $Z$ decay if another electron is reconstructed in the same event, most notably, when a jet is misinterpreted as an electron (a "fake electron").
\item \Wtau, the decay of a $W$ boson into a $\tau$-lepton and a neutrino. Can be misinterpreted if the $\tau$-lepton decays into an electron, and another unrelated electron is reconstructed, as in the previous case.
\item \Ztau, the decay of $Z$ boson into two $\tau$-leptons. Can be misinterpreted if at least one tau decays into electron, and another electron is reconstructed. The case of both tau decaying into electrons and $Z$ boson constructed from them is also possible, since the mass window is wide enough for that.
\item \ttbar\ events, which have lots of decay modes, and thus can be misinterpreted as almost anything, including \Zee. The most common case is \ttbar\ decaying into $W^{+}W^{-}\antibar{b}$, and thus falling into the $WW$ category.
\item $WW$, can be misinterpreted if both bosons decay into $e\nu$.
\item $WZ$, and $ZZ$ events. Although such events contain genuine $Z$ bosons, our analysis requires to exclude them. So the misinterpretation of either of them as a single $Z$ event (by losing the extra electrons, or with a non-leptonic decays) is a background for us.
\end{itemize}

\section{MC simulation process in ATLAS}
\label{sec:MC_sim}

Although the whole process of the production of the MC samples can be considered as "simulation", in this context "the simulation process" refers to the particular stage of the whole production chain: the simulation of the passage of the high-energy particles through the matter of the detector. It is done using the Geant4 software and the highly-accurate 3D model of the detector. The simulation in Geant4 is done as a discrete step-by-step process, with the length of the step being calculated dynamically for each particle, based on particle kinematics and the physical processes that happen to that particle. Because of that the simulation of the particles in vacuum takes much less time than in heavy matter. That is the reason why the majority of the simulation time is spent in calorimeters: they are built of the densest materials with the explicit purpose to stop as many particles as possible. The output of the simulation stage is "hits", the 4D vertexes of energy deposits in sensitive areas of the detectors.

The next stage is to simulate the work of the detector itself, or to convert the energy deposits into detector response, which are usually voltages in the read-out channels. This process is called "digitization", because its output are "digits" that are provided by the read-out channels. During this stage all features of the detector logic are simulated (e.g. electronic noises or channel-dependent variations). This is done by the internal ATLAS digitization software, and because it requires an ultimate knowledge of every particular sub-detector, parts of it are maintained by separate groups related to the respective sub-detectors.

The last step in the production chain is the reconstruction. It is the same for both MC and experimental data samples, as the digitization process aims to provide the same data as we get from the detector during production runs. During this step the responses from the detector are reconstructed into physical objects, which is done in two steps. In the first step the response from the trackers is reconstructed as tracks and the response from the calorimeters is reconstructed as clusters. During the second stage the tracks and clusters are combined into the physical particles. The second stage differs between several so-called "flavors" of the analysis, implementing various reconstruction algorithms for them. The flavors of this stage of reconstruction include e/gamma, jet/EtMiss/tau, b tagging, and muon. \Zee\ analysis uses the first: e/gamma reconstruction. This process is done using the internal ATLAS reconstruction software. More on the reconstruction process with respect to the real data from the detector is described in Section~\ref{sec:Reconstruction}.

The results of the reconstruction are stored in the special format called AOD (Analysis Data Object), which is also developed internally by ATLAS. AODs can be read by the ATLAS analysis framework, which gives easy access to all reconstructed objects.

\subsection{Frozen Showers}
\label{sec:MC_FS}
The frozen showers system (FS) is designed to speed up the Geant4 simulation process inside the EM calorimeters. The main principle of FS is to substitute the low-energy particles with the EM-showers, which are pre-simulated and stored in the libraries (see Figure~\ref{fig:MC_FS_method}). These libraries must be generated in advance for each calorimeter and for each type of particles which is needed to be fast-simulated during the production. The generation process consists mostly of the low-energy particles simulation and recording the information about every energy deposition this particle made. The array of these deposits or "hits" passes through several post-processing procedures in order to reduce its size, and becomes a "shower".

\begin{figure}
\center{
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/MC_FS_method.png}
\caption{Diagram showing the shower substitution of the low-energy particle, during the high-energy particle simulation.}
\label{fig:MC_FS_method}}
\end{figure}

The generation of the shower library is thus a preparatory procedure, which needs to be done every time when something is changed in the Geant4 simulation process. The examples are the change of the Geant4 package version, or the change in the detector geometry. Usually these changes applied between the MC campaigns, which means that the new set of libraries needs to be generated for each campaign. In order to improve results of FS-enabled simulation the libraries are then tuned: the shape and the energy response of the stored showers are slightly changed to provide the changes needed in the resulting simulation.

The processes of the library generation (and tuning) and the production use of the FS system would be described separately in the two following sections.

\subsubsection{FS library generation}
\label{sec:MC_FS_gen}

The library is the set of the showers simulated from the low-energy particles of the same type (electron, photon, etc.). The library should be able to provide the shower for any particle of this type within the determined energy bounds and inside the corresponding sub-detector. Thus, the showers populating the library should also be generated with all the possible energies and in all of the sub-detectors volume. To do this we need to generate the low-energy particles (as during the generation stage described in Section~\ref{sec:MC_gen}) with different energies and different vertexes that covers continuously both volume and energy range.

The easiest way to do it is to use a so-called "particles gun": a tool that can create a particle of arbitrary type, momentum and vertex. This way we will get a library uniformly populated by particles in every part of its kinematic space. This approach has two major disadvantages. First, it reduces the quality of the simulation. As we can't match all of the particle parameters while searching for the suitable shower within the library (it will take too much time and require the libraries of enormous sizes), we disregard some of them and introduce large bins on some others. Because of that the matched shower can have substantially different properties than the required particle. The second problem is the oversized library. During the production simulations the libraries corresponding to some part of the kinematic space (e.g. with the lowest energy of $0-10$~MeV as opposed to $500-1000$~MeV) are requested more often than others. This makes some showers overused and some other underused, making the results of the simulation worse and introducing the redundant memory footprint.

The better way to handle this is to generate the library using the processes similar to the usual MC production chain. It is called a two-staged library generation. The first stage is to conduct the normal simulation of the MC samples, but on much lesser scale: only hundreds of events are required. During the simulation, every time when a low-energy particle is requested to be fast-simulated using FS, the parameters of this low-energy particle are saved as a starting point for the shower. As the starting points tend to be clustered tightly around the track of the initial high-energy particle, only the fraction of the initial starting points is used for library generation in order to rarify them and get a more even coverage of the detector's volume. The sample coverage of all the EM calorimeters in ATLAS detector can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_FS_stpoints}. It can be seen that most of the starting points are in the border regions of the calorimeters, while the central regions are considerably less occupied. It also can be seen that the starting point distribution depends on $\eta$ more than on any other geometry variable, which justifies the choosing of it as the main geometry variable for the library binning. The second stage is the simulation itself. During this stage the starting points are taken one-by-one and simulated using the standard simulation infrastructure, producing the showers, which in turn go to the final library. The density distribution of the simulated hits within the shower can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_FS_shower}. It can be seen the the shower is distributed mostly along the direction of the initial particle. It is important to note, that the scale of this plot in that direction is twice than that of the lateral directions, so in reality the shower is even more stretched along that line.

The library generated with the latter method contains the showers evenly distributed throughout the whole kinematic plane. The sample coverage can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_FS_library}. The distribution of the library density follows the natural occurrence of the showers during the production simulation, with lower-energy showers being more common than the higher-energy ones. The coarse $\eta$-binning ensures that the appropriate shower will be found for every particle in this kinematic region.

The color scale shows not the density of the showers, but rather the energy responce, i.e. the amount of energy registered by the calorimeter versus the initial energy of the starting point. The density of the showers can be derived from the amount of the purple zero-level, which means "no showers present in this region". It can be seen that the average response of the calorimeter is about 2\% and also that the lower-energy bins are much more populated than the higher-energy bins.}

\end{figure}

\end{table}

This way of library generation solves all the problems mentioned above. The bin population problem does not occur because we produce the showers based on the physical MC samples, and the resulting size of each kinematic bin is in direct dependence of the number of times this bin is used. This allows to reduce the size of the library and yet make a bigger diversity.

The post-processing stage consists of merging of the adjacent hits and of removing the far-standing hits that won't contribute to the reconstructed cluster anyway. Also, during this stage the size of the shower is calculated. It is used for containment check during the production (the check that the substitution shower is geometrically fully contained within the target detector volume). The post-processing parameters can be found in Table~\ref{tab:MC_FS_params}.

The tuning of the library can then be applied manually in order to make the results of the FS simulation closer to the standard simulation (also called "full simulation") or data. As this is a process that can't be (as of yet) done automatically, it requires lots of time and effort.

\subsubsection{FS production use}
\label{sec:MC_FS_prod}

During the production run the simulation software checks constantly if any particle agree with the fast-simulation criteria, which is the energy range (should be low enough) and the sub-detector containment (the particle should be far enough from the edges of the sub-detector volume for shower to fit within). The exact values of the aplicable ranges can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:MC_FS_params}. The containment check is energy-dependent, because the sizes of the showers grow with energy, and the more energetic particles should be further from the edges in order for shower to fit.

When the particle with the proper parameters is found, it is then removed from the simulation and replaced with the shower. Before the deposition, the shower is scaled to fully correspond to the particle in energy.

\caption{The simulation speed-up for single electrons events in FCAL region with energies 100-200~GeV.}
\label{fig:MC_FS_speedup}}
\end{figure}

For the MC11c and MC11d campaigns, the data from which is used in this analysis, frozen showers system was enabled by default in FCAL. Several studies showed that the differences introduced by the FS is negligible compared to the differences between MC and data, while the simulation speedup was about 25\%. The smallness of the errors introduced by the FS compared to other fast simulation methods (most notably - FastCaloSim) led to the misunderstanding, when the simulation with the FS system enabled was called "full simulation" as opposed to other, less precise but faster methods, which were called "fast simulation". In this terminology, all of the MC samples used in this analysis are full simulations. But in this chapter, the "full simulation" always means "with the frozen showers disabled".

The sample comparison of the default, non-accelerated MC samples with the samples with enabled frozen showers can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_FS_compare}. It can be seen that the difference between frozen showers enabled and disabled (full simulation) is about 2\%, which is well within the statistical uncertainty. The simulation speed-up can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_FS_speedup}. It can be seen that the CPU time for FS-enabled simulation is almost independent of the electron energy, and is two to three times quicker than the full simulation. On higher energies the speed-up is even more significant, and FCAL region is the one region with the highest number of the high-energy particles.

Apart from the energy scale, another important feature of the simulated electrons is the shower shape variables which are used for electron identification. It is especially important for forward electrons, since with absence of the tracker information the shapes are the only discriminatory variables that help to identify the electrons (see Section~\ref{sec:Rec_elecID} for details). The full list of the shower shape variables can be found in Tab.~\ref{tab:rec_showershapes} in Section~\ref{sec:Rec_elecID}. The comparison of the shower shape variables can be seen in Figures~\ref{fig:MC_fs_shape1} to~\ref{fig:MC_fs_shape6}. All plots are shown in arbitrary scale with the two plots containing the same number of electrons.

\section{MC samples used in analysis}
\label{sec:MC_periods}

During this analysis the MC samples from both MC11c and MC11d campaigns were used. The "d" is chronologically the fourth sample produced for the 2011 data, and the "c" is the third. The decision to make new samples is usually made when some errors in GEANT software or in ATLAS geometry are discovered. The latest "d" sample fixes all such known errors, which affected the electron performance in various cases. The "d" is thus used in cases where the electron performance is important. The main generator used for both signal and background was \Powheg\ with the parton showering provided by \Pythia. The cross-check was done by the same \Powheg\ with the PS done by \Herwig\, and by \Mcatnlo\ also with the \Herwig-provided showers. For the
\Mcatnlo\ and \Powheg\ matrix element calculations the \pdfCteq\ PDF set is used, while showering was performed with \pdfCteql PDF. The list of MC signal periods that was used can be found in Tab.~\ref{tab:MC_periods}, the periods for MC background events are in Tab.~\ref{tab:MC_bg}.

\section{Reweightings}
\label{sec:MC_correction}

The MC samples have a number of known shortcomings, and some data distributions are not described well. To fix this the reconstruction level reweightings based on MC/data samples comparisons, different MC generators comparison on the generation (truth) level, or using the other ATLAS analyses are applied. The weights are applied based on the truth information and are validated using the closure tests. The list of corrections is this:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vertex Spread in $z$-direction Reweighting} is based on the $z$ component of the vertex and aims to decrease the spread of the beam spot in $z$-direction of MC, which is significantly smaller in data (for data $\sigma_z \approx 56$mm, while for narrow beam spot MC sample $\sigma_z = 75$mm and for wide beam spot $\sigma_z = 90$mm). The \texttt{VertexPositionReweightTool} is used for that. The effect of this correction can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_zvtx}.
\item \textbf{$Z$ Boson \pt\ Reweighting} is based on the \pt distribution of the $Z$ bosons, which doesn't describe data well by the MC signal generators used for this analysis. The results from ATLAS $Z$ $\phi^*$ and $\pt$ analyses~\cite{lib:Zphistar} were used for it, and it was done using the \texttt{BosonPtReweightingTool}. The differences between various MC generators in describing the $Z$ boson \pt distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_zpt}.
\item \textbf{$Z$ Boson Line Shape Reweighting} is the reweightings aimed to fix the fundamental shortcomings of the MC generators caused by the electroweak order not being high enough. This reweighting is done using the \texttt{LineShapeTool}. See~\cite{lib:lineshape} for details. The effect of the reweighting can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:MC_lineshape}.
