\chapter{Calibration of the EM calorimeter}
\label{sec:Calibration}

The amount of energy that the EM calorimeter registers differs very much from the total energy of the particle, that needs to be reconstructed. There are several reasons for that: some energy is deposited in the presampler (i.e. outside the calorimeter), some energy is deposited far away from the main cluster and is not registered by the clustering algorithms, but most importantly, lots of energy is deposited in the so-called dead material. The accordeon structure of the central- and the tube structure of the forward- calorimeters both have most of it's mass composed of the non-sensitive materials. Because of these problems, the calorimeters must be calibrated in order to reconstruct the energy of the particles. The process includes
