\chapter{Calibration of the EM calorimeter}
\label{sec:Calibration}

EM calorimeter registers only about 1.5\% of the total energy that the particle deposits in that calorimeter. There are several reasons for that: some energy is deposited in the presampler (i.e. outside of the calorimeter), some energy is deposited away from the main cluster and is not caught by the clustering algorithms, but most importantly, there is the energy that is deposited in the so-called dead material. Both the accordion-shaped central calorimeter and the tube structured forward calorimeter have most of it's mass composed of the non-sensitive materials. Because of this design, the calorimeters must be calibrated in order to reconstruct the  true energy of the particles. Here the process of the calibration of the EM calorimeters will be described. The process consists of the $\chi^{2}$ minimization of the theoretically predicted, reconstructed energy and the truth (initial) energy of the MC sample. The MC sample is simulated using Geant4, the deposited energy is calculated based on the precise geometry model of the detector, the energy of the initial particles is then reconstructed using the theoretical model with several free parameters, and the parameters are then locked with the use of the approximation method.

\section{Theoretical overview}

The theoretically predicted formula for reconstruction of the energy is as follows

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:calib_theory}
\begin{gathered}
E_{e/\gamma} = \underbrace{a(E^{acc}_{tot}, |\eta|) + b (E^{acc}_{tot}, |\eta|) \cdot E^{clLAr}_{ps} + c (E^{acc}_{tot}, |\eta|) \cdot (E^{clLAr}_{ps})^{2}}_\text{energy in front} \\
+ \underbrace{\frac{s^{Acc}_{cl}(X,\eta)}{f_{out}(X,|\eta|)} \cdot \left( \sum\limits_{i=1,3} E^{clLAr}_{i} \right)}_\text{energy in accordion}
 \cdot \underbrace{(1+f_{leak}(X,|\eta|)) \vphantom{\left( \sum\limits_{i=1,3} E^{clLAr}_{i} \right)}}_\text{longitudal leakage}
 \cdot F(|\eta|,\varphi) \,,
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
where

\begin{itemize}
\item $a(E^{acc}_{tot}, |\eta|)$, $b (E^{acc}_{tot}, |\eta|)$ and $c (E^{acc}_{tot}, |\eta|)$ are the parameters that are used to correct the reconstructed energy based on the total energy deposited in the accordion structure ($E^{acc}_{tot}$) and $\eta$. The first two parameters are commonly called offset and slope. The third parameter was assumed to be negligible ($c=0$).
\item $X$ is the longitudinal barycenter of the EM shower, thus representing shower depth. It is calculated as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:calib_barycenter}
X = \frac{\sum\limits^{3}_{i=0}E^{clLAr}_{i} \cdot X_{i}}{\sum\limits^{3}_{i=0}E^{clLAr}_{i}} \,,
\end{equation}
where $E^{clLAr}_{i}$ is the amount of energy deposited in the vsrious compartments of the calorimeter: presampler in case $i=0$ and strip, middle and back for the subsequent $i$ values respectively, and $X_{i}$ is the depth, expressed in radiation length, of the longitudinal center of each compartment computed from the center of the ATLAS detector. The parameters $E^{clLAr}_{i}$ are also used in eq.~\ref{eq:calib_theory} directly.
\item $E^{clLAr}_{ps}$ is the part of the cluster energy measured in the presampler and corrected for the energy deposited in the passive materials.
\item $s^{Acc}_{cl}(X,\eta)$ is a correction factor to the Accordion sampling fraction in the cluster.
\item $f_{out}(X,|\eta|)$ is the correction for the lateral leakage of the shower, i.e. the energy deposited in the calorimeter outside the cluster.
\item $f_{leak}(X,|\eta|)$ is the correction for the longitudal leakage of the shower.
\item $F(|\eta|,\varphi)$ is the correction for the expected performance of the ATLAS detector, as described in~\cite{lib:ATLAS_perf}.
\end{itemize}

As there is no presampler in the region of the outer wheel of the EMEC, as well as the forward region of the detector (can be effectively summarized as $|\eta|>1.8$), the $E^{clLAr}_{ps}$ parameter is parameterized there as the function of the barycenter (see eq.~\ref{eq:calib_barycenter}) and the fractions of the energy deposited in every compartment of the calorimeter.

The coefficients of this equation were optimized with several MC samples with different fixed energies ranged from 5 GeV to 1 TeV.

The reconstruction of the converted and unconverted photons is done using the same technique as for the electrons, with the coefficients approximation being done separately.

\section{Calibration procedures}

\end{figure}

In order to reconstruct the energy of the EM-particles, several procedures are conducted, the overview of which can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:calib}. The steps are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The EM cluster properties, including its longitudinal development, and additional information from the ATLAS inner tracking system, are calibrated to the original electron and photon energy in simulated MC samples. The calibration constants are determined using a multivariate algorithm (MVA), with its optimization being performed separately for electrons and converted and unconverted photons. For this calibration to work properly, the geometry of the detector must be described as precise as possible, so that the interactions of the particles with the detector material were accurate. The material distribution is measured in data using the ratio of the energy in the first-layer to the energy in the second-layer in the longitudinally segmented EM calorimeter. Measuring this ratio in data with different samples (electrons and unconverted photons) allows for a precise determination of the amount of material in front of the calorimeter and provides some sensitivity to its radial distribution.
\item Since the EM calorimeter is longitudinally segmented, the step is taken to equalize the scales of the different longitudinal layers in data with respect to simulation, prior to the determination of the overall energy scale, in order to ensure the correct extrapolation of the response in the full \pt\ range used in the various analyses.
\item The $e/\gamma$ response calibration based on MC simulation is applied to the cluster energies recorded both from collision data and MC samples.
\item A set of corrections are implemented to account for response variations not included in the simulation in specific detector regions, e.g. non-optimal high-voltage regions, geometric effects such as the intermodule widening or biases associated with the LAr calorimeter electronic calibration.
\item The overall electron response in data is calibrated so that it agrees with the expectation from simulation, using a large sample of \Zee\ events. Per-electron scale factors are extracted and applied to electron and photon candidates in data. The studies of the \Zee\ samples showed that the resolution in data is slightly worse than
that in simulation, and appropriate corrections are derived and applied to simulation to match the data.
\item The calibrated electron energy scale is validated with electron candidates from $J/\psi \to ee$ events in data. The resulting scale is dependent on $\eta$ and \pt. The scale factors extracted from \Zee\ events are assumed to be valid also for photons, with the photon-specific systematic uncertainties, which is validated with photon candidates from $Z \to ll\gamma$ events from the collision data.
\end{enumerate}

The detailed description of the calibration process can be found in~\cite{lib:calib}.

\section{Fast simulation impact}

Since both the MC11c and MC11d samples used in this analysis incorporate the results of the frozen showers fast simulation, the studies of the scaling of the calibration results were conducted~\cite{lib:calib_support}. The measurements were done on the central-forward \Zee\ events in the peak mass window. The results of the comparison between samples with enabled and disabled frozen showers fast simulation system showed a difference in $\sim 1$\%, which was then stored as a calibration correction for future use in the analysis.
