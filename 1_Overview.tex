\chapter{Thesis overview}
\label{sec:TOverview}

This thesis describes the measurement of the neutral current Drell-Yan cross-section in the electron channel measured in the forward region of the ATLAS detector. The data was collected throughout 2011 during the collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$~TeV at LHC. For the results unfolding, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation that was generated by the ATLAS group based on the collisions conditions during 2011 was used. The theoretical predictions are based on various parton distribution functions (PDFs) derived from previous experimental data.

All the details of the cross-section measurements are described in the corresponding chapters. The highlights of the analysis include the details of the Monte Carlo generation, the specificies of the event reconstruction and selection, and the distinct features of the ZeeD analysis software, which allowed to speed-up the analysis process by a significant factor.

The focus of this work was the central-forward (CF) variant of the \Zee\ decay, where "central-forward" means that one of the two resulting electrons is detected in the forward calorimeter, while the other in the central. While the CF analysis share a lot with the central-central (CC) one, which is the other possible variant of the \Zee\ decay (both electrons go to the central parts of the detector), there are still some differences in both the analysis chain and in the results. The combination of the two variants of the analysis is possible, and was done in a paper~\cite{lib:wz2011} that is yet to be published. The work done for this thesis contributed to that paper.

\label{sec:TOrganization}

The thesis is organized as follows:
\begin{description}
\item Chapter~\ref{sec:Theory}. Brief introduction to the SM, to $pp$ physics and to $Z$ boson production is given. This chapter also provides a motivation for the \Zee\ cross-section measurement.
